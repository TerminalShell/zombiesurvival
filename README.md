# ($>) Terminal Shell - Zombie Survival

## Description
The Zombie Survival gamemode for Garry's Mod, as modified by Terminal Shell, based on the original by JetBoom of NoxiousNet.

This is a faster paced version of the game, which attempts to put greater focus on the balance between the "run-and-gun" and barricading gameplay styles. It also features custom zombie classes, weapons, abilities, and a hybrid system between the arsenal crate and the old weapon upgrades.

#History
Terminal Shell was founded back in Garry's Mod 10 as a Zombie Survival server, running on a self-modified version original ZS gamemode code. As Garry's Mod 13 came about, we moved to the new codebase, but wanted to recreate the feeling of the original ZS, particularly the faster gameplay style. To that end, Terminal Shell was succeeded by Funquisition Daily, which continued this and further developed new features until it too passed. After a couple years absent however, we decided it was time to bring it back under the Terminal Shell name once again, and continue development.

## Notes
This gamemode is a modified version of Zombie Survival by JetBoom of NoxiousNet, but branched out back when it was on SVN. Given that so much has changed on both sides over the years, we decided to create a standalone repository with our copy rather than try and rebuild it from the current official one.
