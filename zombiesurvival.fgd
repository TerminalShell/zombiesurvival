"A standard Half-Life 2 grenade that can be acquired at 100 points. In the right situations, this weapon can potentially produce huge amounts of kills. This weapon is especially good in maps that involve zombies struggling to get through a narrow entrance to reach the humans. It is also a good way of getting rid of Poison Headcrabs. However, if used wrong, these can do drastic damage to a barricade, so use with caution. Comes in a set of 3. " []

"A replica of the same shotgun that Father Grigori used in Half-Life 2. It is a rifle based weapon and uses the same type of ammunition as the stubber and the slug rifle. it is more accurate than the stubber (except when crouching and using iron sights at the same time) and deals 2 times more damage than the stubber does. it is a perfect weapon for sniping wraiths, fasties, chems, and poison headcrabs. Compared to the crossbow it is less powerful and as such it has 36 bullets while the crossbow has only 24 bolts. " []

@PointClass base(Weapon) studio("models/weapons/w_crossbow.mdl") = weapon_zs_crossbow : "Points to acquire: 125, Clip size: 1, ammo type: xbowbolt\n"+
"A more realistic version of the Half-Life 2 crossbow, this weapon is extremely effective in hallways and clusterfucks. It is the only weapon in the game with a 100% accuracy at all times and it has the ability to penetrate through multiple zombies dealing serious collateral damage. A zoom view can be activated using the secondary mouse button. This weapon is very effective in a bottleneck situation. Its primary disadvantage is that it is exceedingly difficult to use, in fact it is the most difficult weapon to handle in Zombie Survival. Additionally, its bullet is physical and is affected strongly by gravity. " []

"The Slug Rifle shoots one bullet that deals a tremendous amount of damage and upon crouching and using ironsights, the accuracy becomes 99% accurate, thus making it a perfect sniper-like weapon in the game. The sound it creates is also of epic proportions. The weapon is ammo friendly. Its only limitation is that it is completely useless at close range and that you need to use the other weapons you have to dispose of a zombie that gets very close to you. It's also ineffective against packs of zombies. It comes with a low amount of ammo but remaining ammo from an annabelle or a stubber can be used in the slug rifle. " []

"The Boom Stick deals more damage than any other weapon in the game. It fires 12 shots that do 25 damage each. The maximum damage is 600 if you include the head shot damage bonus. It has a low firing rate since it has to reload after firing just once. This weapon has the unique ability of consuming two shots per attack. If one hasn't picked up shotgun ammo from somewhere, they will only be able to fire the boomstick 18 times before running out of ammo. " []

"The Adonis is a 120 point assault rifle that combines high bullet power with the accuracy of the inferno. It comes with a low clip size and a very low firing rate however. This is the perfect weapon to use against chems from a distance. It comes with the ability to slow zombies it hits. Shooting 4 times at the feet of an approaching zombie is a very good way to help the others take out the zombies. " []
